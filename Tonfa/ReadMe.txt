Reworked tonfa animations and icons

There are both epfs and pngs contained in the folders.

There are new sprites based off of Retail Darkages metals as well as some new metals and a bunch of random colour combos.

Suggestions on what sprites to assign to metals if you want to use all sprites
Use the MythrilAlt as Mythril
Use Original Mythril as Iron
Use Original Iron as Steel

Use the "PaletteForSprites.pal" as the palette for all weapon sprites.
Use the "Rename.pal" for item icons
